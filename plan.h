Game Idea: ADVENTURELIKE

Explore a simple, abstract, ruined world with few hazards. Collect a few key items to unlock areas and make 
escape possible. Death is punished by returning the player to the nearest activated spawn point, of which
there are many. 

Some hazards/puzzles:

An area that can only be passed by missing a spawn point, intentionally dying and respawning at a previous
spawn point.

An underwater danger that must be distracted 

Globally toggleable walls, standard switches throughout the world allow these walls to be lowered or raised

Sliding ice / directional movement tiles like chips challenge or pokemon
